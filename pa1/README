This is my README file which briefly describes what my program does and how it
works. 

The files I have included in the turn in are README, Makefile, and Subset.c

For pa1, I used recursion to print all the subsets in the user given set, in
number order.

For example if the input for my pa1 was "Subset 4,2" The output would be,
{1,2}
{1,3}
{1,4}
{2,3}
{2,4}
{3,4}
