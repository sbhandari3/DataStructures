This is my README file which briefly describes what my program does and how it
works.

The files I have included in the turn in are README, Makefile, and S.c

For pa2, I used recursion to find all the solutions to how many Queens I can have on an n-sized board, needing n amount of Queens.

For example if the input is Queens 4, the output of my program would be,

4-Queens has 2 solutions.

If the input is "Queens -v 4", the output is,

(2, 4, 1, 3)
(3, 1, 4, 2)
4-Queens has 2 solutions.
